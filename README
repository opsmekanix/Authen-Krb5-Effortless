Authen-Krb5-Effortless

This module is a subclass to Authen::Krb5, and adds an 'Effortless' interface to authenticate against a KDC server.  It's intention is to provide a kinder
means of integrating Kerberos tickets with your application.   While there is Authen::Krb5::Simple, Authen::Krb5::Simpledoesn't support keytab authentication.
As I really needed both passphrase and keytab authentication, I wrote a module to subclass Authen::Krb5.  I hope someone finds this module helpful.
